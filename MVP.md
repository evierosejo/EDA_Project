## MVP: Top 10 Busiest Station Entrances in MTA Data 
The goal of this project is to optimize the street teams' canvassing work in order to increase gala attendance and spread awareness for WTWY.

To explore this goal, I first began by finding the top ten busiest MTA stations and lines by taking the summation of daily turnstile entries 
for the three most current months, i.e., June, July and August of 2021 for each station entrance. 

The bar chart depicts the top ten busiest station entrances by total entries. 
As seen above, 34 Street-Herald Square entrance for lines BDFMNQRW is the busiest station entrance and, therefore, an optimal place for the street teams to canvas at.
