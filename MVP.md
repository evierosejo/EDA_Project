## MVP: Top 10 Busiest Station Entrances in MTA Data 
The goal of this project is to optimize the street teams' canvassing work in order to increase gala attendance and spread awareness for WTWY.

To explore this goal, I first began by finding the top ten busiest MTA stations and lines by taking the summation of daily turnstile entries 
for the three most current months, i.e., June, July and August of 2021 for each station entrance. 

The bar chart depicts the busiest station entrances with the use of total entries by station name in addition to line name(s). 
This shows that the 34 Street-Herald Square entrance for lines BDFMNQRW is the busiest station entrance.
